# üá´üá∑ Predicting Restaurant Success in France (TripAdvisor Dataset)

This project aims to predict whether a restaurant in **France** will be successful based on a variety of available features (tags, cuisine, location, operating hours, awards, etc.).

---

## üì¶ Dataset

- **Source**: [TripAdvisor European Restaurants ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/tripadvisor-european-restaurants)
- **Scope**: Focused on restaurants located in **France**.
- **Google Drive (Raw, Processed & Outputs)**:

## üìä Project Summary

1. **Goal**: To test whether a given restaurant in France is likely to be **successful**.
2. **Success Criteria**:  
   - Defined using the **75th percentile** of both:
     - Number of reviews
     - Average review score
   - This creates a balanced label for classification purposes.
3. **Review Data Handling**:  
   - All review-related features are saved in `dropped_columns.csv` for future reference.  
   - These features were **excluded from training** because review data is **not available for new restaurants**.
   - The dropped review columns can be used later to refine the success criteria
4. **Awards Consideration**:  
   - If a restaurant **has moved** and held awards previously, that is preserved.  
   - For new locations or new restaurants, award data is **set to 0 or unknown**.

## üß† Code Structure

The project is organized into two main directories for code and experimentation:

### üóÇÔ∏è `src/` ‚Äî Utility Functions
This folder contains Python modules with **reusable functions** developed for the project, such as:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature encoding
- Data splitting (`prepare_data`)
- Utility logic used across notebooks

> All key logic is modularized here to keep the notebooks clean and focused.

### üìì `notebooks/` ‚Äî Main Project Work
All core modeling, analysis, and visualizations were performed inside Jupyter notebooks:
- üìä Exploratory analysis
- ‚öôÔ∏è Model training
- üîç Feature selection
- üìà Performance comparisons
- üíæ Model saving and outputs

These notebooks are well-commented and structured to reflect the full pipeline from raw data to final model evaluation.

## üìÅ Folder Structure (Google Drive)

- `/data/raw_data` ‚Äì Original Kaggle data
- `/data/processed_data` ‚Äì Cleaned and encoded feature sets
- `/data/external` ‚Äì Any external data used
- `/outputs/results` ‚Äì Feature selection summaries, evaluation metrics
- `/outputs/figures` ‚Äì Plots and visualizations
- `/outputs/models` ‚Äì Final trained models (`.pkl`) ready to use

---

## üõ† Known Issues

- ‚ùå A compatibility issue was encountered with **XGBoost and Scikit-learn version ‚â•1.6**, which led to errors related to `__sklearn_tags__`.
- ‚úÖ This was resolved by **manually running the hyperparameter grid** (instead of using `RandomizedSearchCV`), allowing for stable and controlled optimization.

---

## üöÄ Future Plans

1. üîß **Interactive Input UI**  
   - A notebook or web interface where users can input their restaurant‚Äôs data and receive a prediction.
2. üåç **Generalization to Other Countries**  
   - Extend the model to work across Europe, and eventually globally, by retraining on a more diverse dataset.

## üì¶ Installation

You can set up the project environment using either **Poetry** or `requirements.txt`.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 1: Using Poetry (recommended)

1. Clone the repository or download the code
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run:

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

This will automatically install the correct Python version and all dependencies from the `pyproject.toml`.

> Make sure you have [Poetry installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 2: Using `requirements.txt`

If you prefer to use `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all required packages based on the project's environment.

## üí° Final Notes

This project offers a strong starting point for restaurant business analysis in France, with potential for real-world applications in business planning, location scouting, and investor forecasting.
